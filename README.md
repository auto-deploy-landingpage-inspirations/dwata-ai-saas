# Dwata

## A powerful, self-hosted, open source admin at a fraction of cost to develop.

**Manage your SQL/API data (MySQL/PgSQL, Stripe, Mailchimp, etc.) & Content in one place with your entire team. Works with any backend.**

## Why would you use Dwata?
If you are building an admin on say Django, Laravel, Express or any other framework then:
- Admin is not used by your customer
- Developers' time is prioritized to customer
- Your team will need a great admin to manage the business
- Admin takes time/money to build

Building an admin application is an undifferentiated investment that does not add direct value to your customers.

Dwata provides a feature rich admin that has CMS, visual Data explorer, User management and also integrates with third party service APIs.

## Features on roadmap:
- CRUD admin for databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Explore SQL data without any SQL knowledge
- Highlight important data (rows), add notes, pin them
- Backend language/framework agnostic
- Integrates with third party services like Stripe
- Browse third party API data or merge them with SQL data
- Create dashboards with data from multiple tables or APIs
- Call existing backend logic (Mark Order as `Read to Ship`)
- Content management with Markdown
- Media management (S3, Dropbox storage)
- Team wide notes on data points, collaboration tools
- Invite guests to specific views/dashboards (read only access)

We are in alpha development stage.
