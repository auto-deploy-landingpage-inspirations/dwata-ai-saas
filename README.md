- It can connect directly with Stripe, PayPal, Mailchimp or any other service you use
- dwata Frontend then uses all this information to build dynamic UI with Grids, Reports, Dashboards etc.
- Has Widgets for everything from Numbers to Dates/Timezones, Geographic data...
- Has internal search server for full search across any of your data sources
- Has internal cache so Queries are not repeatedly and unnecessarily hitting your databases
